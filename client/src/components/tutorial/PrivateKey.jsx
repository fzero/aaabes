            A Private Key is a 256-bit security level number that is generated
            from the mnemonic phrase. The private key is similar to the passcode
            used to access your bank account, except it is a little more secure
            than a 4 digit pin. The key is what permits you to send irreversible
            transactions to anyone, anywhere. This private key is crucial to the
            ownership of your crypto-wallet, and everything it contains.

            <span className="warning">Warning:</span>
            If anyone discovers your private key, they would have the ability to
            access your wallet and authorize the transfer of your coins. Please
            write down this key and keep it in a secure location, preferably
            keeping both a hard and soft copy.

            The Bitcoin private key is an integer between 1 and 10^77, which
            makes it essentially infinite. If a super computer could process 1
            trillion keys per second, it would still take 1 million times the
            age of the universe to count them all. Also this process is so
            expensive that it would consume all the energy that the sun can
            produce for 32 years.
