# Baaaes ðŸ’“

**Baaaes** is an opinionated, fully fleshed-out API server boilerplate based on [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com) and [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com) with working examples and tests - you just have to jump in and modify it to your needs. It makes extensive use of `async`/`await` to eliminate callback hell _completely_ and make Javascript your bae.

## TL;DR HOWTO

1. Download the [zip package](https://github.com/fzero/baaaes/archive/master.zip) and unzip it somewhere (cloning is **not** recommended for normal use)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Postgres DB configuration
4. If you need HTTPS support, run `npm run makecert`

You should be ready to go now! Start the server with `npm start` and run tests with `npm test`.

## How & why?

The basic code was created with [`express-generator`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html), then the following changes were made:

- Complete conversion to native Node ES6 syntax.
- HTTPS support included, and you can generate self-signed certificates for development by running `npm run makecert`. Note that you **will** see warning messages; use [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and a real domain name to avoid this.
- [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) support baked in with configuration examples.
- Differentiated environments (`development`, `test` and `production`) defined by the `APP_ENV` environment variable.
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates for HTML views.
- [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com) as ORM, along with an example model implementation making extensive use of the `async`/`await` pattern to minimize frustration.
- Example API routes _with fully working RESTful CRUD endpoints_, also using `async`/`await`!
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) integration tests for the example API. And guess what? We're using `async`/`await` for that too!

## Making Express great again with `async`/`await`

Let's face it, working with databases in Node has always been frustrating (to say the least). Node 7 introduces native support for `async`/`await`, which is nothing more than syntatic sugar on top of the Promise pattern. This means that **if your code uses promises, you can use `async`/`await` right now!**

So instead of writing an API route like this...

```js
// GET /users
// Returns a JSON array containing all available user objects
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  models.User.findAll()
    .then(result => {
      res.json(result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      res.status(400).json(error);
    });
});
```

...you can write this instead!

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    res.json(await models.User.findAll());
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json(error);
  }
});
```

Note how you can use `try`/`catch` for async error handling - and YES, IT WORKS! ðŸ’“

## External dependencies

**Baaaes** expects a Postgres database up and running, but you can modify the code to use any other database supported by Sequelize. You'll have to install the corresponding `npm` packages and modify the `.env` file. [Relevant documentation here.](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/docs/getting-started/)

Out of the box, **Baaaes** uses URI-style configuration for database connections, but you can use as many environment variables as you want (e.g. `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST` and so on). **Just make sure to keep you test database separated; all data is destroyed every time the test suite runs!**

## Note about boilerplates in general

The objective of Baaaes is **not** to prescribe how you should organize your project, but showing **one** particular way to do it (hence _opinionated_).

If you already know what you're doing, you can configure Express, Sequelize, Knex, Mongo and whatever else you're using however you want. Still, it can be useful to take a peek at some of this code to inform your decisions.

This is one of the reasons I've decided against making Baaaes into a code generation package (such as `express-generator`). The other reason is it would be too much like creating yet another Javascript framework, and **NOBODY** wants that.

**NOBODY.**
